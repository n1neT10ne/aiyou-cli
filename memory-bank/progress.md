## Current Status

The project is in a functional state with all core features implemented. Recent additions include support for multi-line system prompts in the YAML configuration and the ability to read messages from standard input, which were the last items on the initial TODO list.

The codebase is clean and well-structured, following Go best practices. The command-line interface is intuitive and well-documented.

## Known Issues

1. **No Formal Testing**: The project lacks comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Limited Error Handling**: Some edge cases may not have specific error messages
3. **Documentation Gaps**: Some advanced usage scenarios are not well-documented
4. **Version Management**: No formal versioning strategy beyond manual updates

## Next Milestones

1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Add unit and integration tests
2. **Advanced Features**: Implement conversation history and interactive mode
3. **Documentation Expansion**: Create more examples and integration guides
4. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and address any performance bottlenecks
